For a 24-hour hackathon, my partner and I decided to work on a project inspired by a need of "עתיד פסגות" school. 
Teachers wanted a website where they could post questions at the end of lessons for students to answer, allowing them to gauge understanding. 
We took this idea further by implementing Socket.IO to enable real-time interaction. Now, students can simply join their classroom on their phones and immediately respond to questions posted by the teacher.


to use the application, you can create a new student or teacher (student can only answer questions recived in rooms they are in, teachers can create rooms with wanted students in them, and send them a question).
in order to create a new student the passKey is "newstudent" and for teacher is "teacher#19".
